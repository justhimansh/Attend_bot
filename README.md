# Attend Bot

This is my first project that uses selenium automation testing. I decided to create an
automation (bot) which goes to my lectures for me. This project can be run at certain
times which can be set within the script so it will always be on time for a meeting. 
It simply opens up chrome, logs into my university's webpage and types in my login, 
finds my class to attend, joins the meeting on team with my name and with microphone
and webcam disabled. The bot also quits the meeting after the length of 2 hours which 
is how long a lecture normally is.

## Features

- Fully automated
- Joins and leaves at setable times
- Can be implemented to join via Canvas or Microsoft Teams



## Lessons Learned

Building this project helped me understand how to extract information from a webpage 
to use when creating an automation. I learned about xpaths and how to use them in python
with the webdriver. I also learned how to extract information using id, class, css 
selector and text. This project opened up many new possible future automations I 
could create to make my life easier.
